## 12 Reasons Why RExpress is Awesome!

**1. Written For Full Stack Development**
    
> Your app has a cleanly designed `Express`-based API back-end **and** a well-organized client

**2. Designed to Promote Modular Development**
    
> MVC patterns from the get go using `BackboneJS`
> Client-side files integrated using AMD via `RequireJS`

**3. Client libraries are already set up for you**

> No need for copying a pasting a bunch of libraries from node_modules. 
> RExpress does that for you, right out of the box!

**4. API Authentication Out of the Box**

> `Passport.js` can be enabled with the `--auth` flag when generating a new app

**5. CORS-enabled Out of the Box**

> `CORS` can be enabled with the `-C` option when generating a new app

**6. MongoDB Support Out of the Box**

> Your choice of `Mongoose` or `Monk`. Just use the `-M` or `-m` flags, respectively to enable the one you want.

> Plus, the required `data/db` directory is created for you

**7. Bootstrap + JQuery = OMG!**

> Comes pre-installed with Bootstrap and JQuery

**8. Better Naming Conventions for Public Directories**

> `javascript` --> `js`
> `stylesheets` --> `css`

> Let's get with the program, folks!

**9. Common Client-side Matters Already Dealt With**
    
> `client/img` Images directory
> `client/fonts` Fonts directory
> `client/templates` Handlebars templates
> 
> No app should be without these!

**10. Procfile Generated To Manage Your Deploy**

> `Foreman` is your friend

**11. Prevent Accidental Override of Your App**
